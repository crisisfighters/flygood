FlyGood is a mobile web app that allows offsetting flights and tipping initiatives. FlyGood is brought to you by [CrisisFighters](https://crisisfighters.org/).

[Climate Stewards](https://www.climatestewards.org/offset) and [Gold Standard](https://www.goldstandard.org/impact-quantification/gold-standard-global-goals) do an excellent job at providing a scrutinized, transparent way of setting of the emissions generated by each flight. This project aims at providing an easier-to-use website to channel money to them while also allowing to “tip” organizations that actively fight to stop the climate crisis.
